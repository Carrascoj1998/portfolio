				<p id="speakable-summary">Protests across the U.S. over police violence and systemic racism against Black Americans have sparked gaming companies like Electronic Arts, Epic Games and Sony Interactive Entertainment/PlayStation to publish <a href="https://www.theesa.com/perspectives/video-game-industry-response-to-nationwide-protests/">statements of their support</a> and make donations to relevant advocacy organizations.</p>
<p>These are positive actions, but the most impactful thing game companies can do is take action internally. Racial bias is baked, usually unintentionally, into games by those who develop them. This creates a recurring pattern of Black and Latinx characters being stereotyped or completely absent in games, which is invalidating and demeaning.</p>
<p>There are <a href="https://newzoo.com/insights/articles/the-global-games-market-will-generate-152-1-billion-in-2019-as-the-u-s-overtakes-china-as-the-biggest-market/">2.5 billion gamers</a> in the world, a group that includes consumers across every ethnicity and age (especially in mobile gaming, the largest market segment). <a href="https://qz.com/1433085/the-era-of-white-male-games-for-white-male-gamers-is-ending/">Quartz has noted</a> that “57% of video game players in the U.S. between the ages of 6 and 29 will be people of color in less than 10 years.” Black and Latinx youth in the US <a href="http://cmhd.northwestern.edu/wp-content/uploads/2011/06/SOCconfReportSingleFinal-1.pdf">spend more time per day</a>, on average, on both mobile games and console games than white youth. For hundreds of millions of gamers globally — particularly in demographics driving the industry’s rapid growth — there are very few games whose stories center on characters like them. That is also a missed business opportunity.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>“Telling these stories isn’t as niche as people think it is. Look at [the Marvel movie] <i>Black Panther</i>,” says Rashad Redic, co-founder and Chief Creative Officer of <a href="http://brasslionentertainment.com/">Brass Lion Entertainment</a>, “The content is defined by whether it&#8217;s entertaining, period.”</p>
<p>Beyond characters’ skin color, there are subtle aspects of game development that contribute to underrepresentation or misrepresentation. The consistent view among gaming executives and researchers I interviewed for this article is that the lack of diversity among employees at leading gaming companies results in leadership remaining largely oblivious to this.</p>
<p>Raising this simple critique isn’t always welcome. Games industry journalist Gita Jackson, for example, has described the criticism she gets anytime she mentions the race of characters within a game. “I think the presence of more video game characters who are women of color is good … These should not be controversial statements — I’m simply stating something I appreciate, something that’s relevant to me,” she <a href="https://kotaku.com/what-its-like-to-write-about-race-and-video-games-1832886047">wrote last year</a>, “and yet some readers responded as if I’d suggested that all gamers should amputate their pinky toes.”</p>
<h2>Character representation</h2>
<p>One of the most extensive studies of racial representation in games was <a href="http://dmitriwilliams.com/VirtualCensusFinal.pdf">a 2009 study</a> that analyzed 150 of the most popular titles. Black characters comprised 10.7% of characters, roughly on parity with the then-most recent census data that 12.3% of Americans are Black, and only 2.7% of characters were Latinx (relative to 12.5% representation in the U.S. population). But Dmitri Williams, a professor at the University of Southern California and the lead author of that study, says that Black representation is even lower if you only look at primary characters and that in any case “athletes in sports games account for most of the Black characters in those games.”</p>
<p>Kishonna Gray, a professor at the University of Illinois—Chicago, highlights that merely tracking the number of Black characters present in games misses the point of how they are represented. “In film, there have historically been three roles you see Black characters in: Black as violent, Black as the sidekick, Black as the help. This has also been true in video games.”</p>
<p>Furthermore, she argues that “sports games should be removed from those analyses since they are just copying real people from the real world” and mask the statistics that would show how infrequently Black characters arise from the creative process at most game studios.</p>
<p>Casting specific demographics in a certain light in any form of media has an impact on consumers’ perception of those demographics in the real world. At least <a href="https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Grace_Yang9/publication/263697104_Effects_of_Avatar_Race_in_Violent_Video_Games_on_Racial_Attitudes_and_Aggression/links/0deec53baedee5e0fd000000/Effects-of-Avatar-Race-in-Violent-Video-Games-on-Racial-Attitudes-and-Aggression.pdf">one academic study</a> found that white participants were more likely to associate Black faces with negative words after playing a violent video game as a Black character than after playing a violent video game as a white character.</p>
<p>When the only option to experience the fantasy worlds of many games is through white characters, it internalizes in many gamers that those fantasy worlds weren’t designed for them. “Anything is possible in games,” Gray told me in reference to her passion for the industry, “But anything is only possible for white characters. When they add Black characters to a game they root them only in their real world context … why can’t Black characters ride dragons?”</p>
<h2>Game developer demographics</h2>
<p>Data has shown that the representation of different races within games correlates to the racial makeup of the game development community. According to Williams. “It was pretty much a one-for-one representation.”</p>
<p>The International Game Developers Association (IGDA) found in the <a href="https://s3-us-east-2.amazonaws.com/igda-website/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/29093706/IGDA-DSS-2019_Summary-Report_Nov-20-2019.pdf">2019 edition of its annual survey</a> that among game developers worldwide:</p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;">81% identify as “white/Caucasian/European”</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;">7% identify as “Hispanic/Latinx”</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;">2% identify as “Black/African-American/African/Afro-Caribbean”</li>
</ul>
<p>“People draw their inspiration from their experience,” explained Gray, “that’s why we still have a problem with representation.” Redic said that during his career — which includes roles at top gaming companies like Bethesda and Crytek — he has frequently been “the only — or one of very few — Black guy among hundreds of game devs at a company.”</p>
<p>Tanya DePass, founder of the nonprofit I Need Diverse Games, makes the point that for companies wanting to improve diversity in their content, “the biggest thing is diverse staff, and diverse staff at leadership level.” Moreover, her advice to game studios is to hire outside experts who can review their development plans and give feedback on where their content may stereotype or misrepresent an ethnic group: “Bring in diversity consultants in the beginning, not a month before launch, and treat it seriously.”</p>
<p>One company that uses consultants is Niantic, the studio behind Pokémon Go and Harry Potter: Wizards Unite. It has also implemented “Diversity and Inclusion check-ins through a game’s concept, preproduction and postproduction phases,” according Trinidad Hermida, the company&#8217;s Head of Diversity and Inclusion. “These check-ins look at everything from character design to evaluating whether the internal Niantic team working the product is diverse,” she explained, “Every new game we publish must go through this process to launch.”</p>
<h2>Good intentions, slow progress</h2>
<p>That <a href="https://s3-us-east-2.amazonaws.com/igda-website/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/29093706/IGDA-DSS-2019_Summary-Report_Nov-20-2019.pdf">IGDA survey</a> last year also found that 87% of game developers said “diversity in game content” is “very important” or “somewhat important,” which offers optimism that representation can improve as developers are pushed to think of diversity less in the abstract and more in the context of the specific games they work on.</p>
<p>The number of Black or Latinx characters across popular games is indeed growing, even if that progress is quite slow relative to the pace at which the demographic makeup of the gaming community is diversifying. Examples can be found in Moby Games’ <a href="https://www.mobygames.com/game-group/protagonist-black">list of games with Black protagonists</a> through 2017 and the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_black_video_game_characters">list of Black video game characters</a> on Wikipedia.</p>
<p>Giving users lots of options to customize their avatar’s appearance goes a long way in helping different demographics of gamers feel welcomed and emotionally attached to a game. This is increasingly common in games, but there are often more limited options for Black avatars, like the ability to choose natural hair styles. DePass says that game developers “are often not thinking about the fact that there are other people who also want to see themselves [in creating their avatar].” And when they do, the homogeneity of their team can lead to foreseeable mistakes. For example, DePass expressed that “If Black hair is available at all, it looks bad. Sometimes there&#8217;s 5 inches between braids; or Afros look like steel wool. It’s like, &#8216;Have you ever met a Black person or seen photos of black hairstyles?&#8217;”</p>
<h2>Cyberbullying</h2>
<p>Cyberbullying is a big issue in games, MMOs in particular, and in their efforts to combat it, gaming executives should recognize that both female gamers and Black and Latinx founders are particularly targeted with abuse, often denigrated with slurs and racist jokes.</p>
<p>A small but important step that developers can take, according to Gray, is giving players the option to mark racist behavior as the reason for submitting a complaint against another user. Many games have added the ability to mark a complaint as being due to gender discrimination, she notes, but the lack of a similar option for racism permits game studios to remain ignorant about how often racism occurs on their platform. Collecting data on a problem allows for more measurement of that problem and more effective action to address it.</p>
<h2>Building for an underserved market</h2>
<p>As DePass noted in our call, “There aren’t a lot of Black creators of games, but there are a lot of Black buyers of games.” There is business opportunity in creating content that better speaks to often-overlooked segments of the gamer community.</p>
<p>The natural question here is: If making games with narratives that center on Black or Latinx characters is a compelling business opportunity, why hasn’t it already been tapped? Leadership at established gaming companies “have a sense of who <i>is</i> a gamer, and who <i>isn’t</i>, that is very archaic” says <a href="https://glowup.games/">Glow Up Games</a> CEO Mitu Khandaker, whose studio is developing a mobile game leveraging IP from the HBO show &#8220;Insecure.&#8221;</p>
<p>Likewise, she explains, entrepreneurs who found their own studios with this thesis quickly find that the major funding sources (publishers and venture capitalists) are composed of ethnically homogenous teams who are quick to judge such games as niche.</p>
<p>As a result, the game developers focused on building games that speak to Black and Latinx audiences remain stuck in the indie games space, lacking the resources or industry credibility to develop a AAA title.</p>
<p>There’s a long list of societal problems that contribute to the disproportionately small number of Black software engineers entering the games industry or in leadership roles in the industry, from less access to high-quality STEM education in K-12 to employers <a href="https://www.brookings.edu/blog/brown-center-chalkboard/2019/11/22/hbcus-are-leading-centers-of-education-why-are-they-treated-as-second-class-institutions/">devaluing degrees from historically Black colleges and universities</a> to the well-researched pattern of <a href="https://hbswk.hbs.edu/item/minorities-who-whiten-job-resumes-get-more-interviews">resumes with white-sounding names</a> receiving dramatically more job interviews.</p>
<p>Khandaker noted that the perceived lack of representation and role models for Black engineers looking at the gaming industry causes many to avoid the sector altogether, and many who enter the industry leave it in frustration.</p>
<h2>Taking responsibility</h2>
<p>On our recent call, Williams shared his memory of speaking on a panel about racial bias in games at the DICE Conference for game executives: “In the few minutes of transition between the prior session and my panel, roughly 90% of the audience left.”</p>
<p>A repeated sentiment among several of those I interviewed for this post was that the problem is not gaming executives with harmful intent so much as gaming executives lacking the interest or empathy to treat diversity as an issue that they personally should dedicate time to address. Discussion of diversity, whether at conferences or otherwise, is still too often treated as a token matter for purposes of political correctness, not a pressing business problem to solve.</p>
<p>If the current news cycle is helping change that attitude and energize executives in the industry to step up, the most impactful action they can take is to approach diversity as a product development priority not as a PR issue.</p>

However, TechCrunch has been told that Clark County regulators have approved just 11 human-driven vehicles so far, set strict speed limits and forbidden the use of on-board collision-avoidance technology that is part of Tesla&#8217;s &#8220;full self-driving&#8221; Autopilot advanced driver assistance system. Tesla&#8217;s Autopilot system technically does not rise to the level of fully autonomous, even though it is branded as such. It is considered \u2014 even internally, <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2021\/05\/07\/tesla-refutes-elon-musks-timeline-on-full-self-driving\/\">according to exchanges between Tesla and California regulators<\/a> \u2014 an advanced driver assistance system that can automate certain functions.<\/p><div class=\"piano-inline-promo\"><\/div>\n<p>LVCC\u2019s parent body, the Las Vegas Convention and Visitor\u2019s Authority, created a contract aimed at incentivizing Musk and ensuring promises are met. The contract is for a fixed price, and TBC has to hit specific milestones to receive all of its payments. The contract provides payments at different points in the process, such as completing the bare tunnels, the entire working system, finishing a <span style=\"font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;\">test period and safety report and then demonstrating it can carry passengers. The final three milestones relate to how many passengers it can carry. If the Loop can demonstrate moving 2,200 passengers an hour, TBC will get $4.4 million, then the same payment again for hitting 3,300, and the same again for 4,400 passengers an hour. Together, these capacity payments represent 30% of the fixed-price contract.<\/span><\/p>\n<p>Instead of moving more than 4,000 passengers an hour, the constrained system could limit the capacity to less than 1,000, exposing TBC to hefty penalties for missing contractual targets. TBC doesn&#8217;t generate revenue from charging passengers (the rides are free).<\/p>\n<p><em><strong>Update<\/strong><\/em>: Shortly after publication, Steve Hill, president of the Las Vegas Convention and Visitors Authority (LVCVA), <a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/SHillforVegas\/status\/1398497136623247361?s=20\">tweeted that a Loop<\/a> test this week, with a few hundred participants, had demonstrated its planned 4,400 passenger per hour capacity. This could release the additional construction funds mentioned below. TBC still has to achieve this figure during actual conferences in the months ahead to avoid penalties. TechCrunch shared its reporting with the LVCVA, Clark Country and TBC numerous times, over a period of weeks, prior to publication. Only LVCVA provided a substantive reply, and none addressed the question of capacity, nor the outstanding questions about children or passengers with mobility issues.<\/p>\n<p>For instance, during a large trade show like CES, the LVCC will pay TBC $30,000 for every day it operates and manages the system, according to a <a href=\"https:\/\/www.documentcloud.org\/documents\/20702362-2021-1-management-agreement-feb-4-final\">management agreement<\/a> newly obtained by TechCrunch. However, the original contract signed by TBC in 2019 specifies a $300,000 penalty for each large convention where TBC cannot move around 4,000 people per hour.<\/p>\n<p>This means that over the course of a three- or four-day event, TBC stands to lose hundreds of thousands of dollars, above and beyond the cost of running the system. In a typical pre-pandemic year, LVCC would host around a dozen such large shows. It&#8217;s unclear if TBC is planning on another means of making money such as revenue from advertising in its cars.<\/p>\n<div class=\"embed breakout\">\n<blockquote class=\"wp-embedded-content\" data-secret=\"Nf5h7wegCw\"><p><a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2018\/11\/16\/elon-musk-boring-company-the-brick-store\/\">The Boring Company goes brick-and-mortar with The Brick Store<\/a><\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p><iframe class=\"wp-embedded-content\" sandbox=\"allow-scripts\" security=\"restricted\" style=\"position: absolute; clip: rect(1px, 1px, 1px, 1px);\" title=\"&#8220;The Boring Company goes brick-and-mortar with The Brick Store&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch\" src=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2018\/11\/16\/elon-musk-boring-company-the-brick-store\/embed\/#?secret=Nf5h7wegCw\" data-secret=\"Nf5h7wegCw\" width=\"800\" height=\"450\" frameborder=\"0\" marginwidth=\"0\" marginheight=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\"><\/iframe><\/div>\n<p>This capacity issue is already costing TBC money.

These reportedly include a 40 mph overall speed limit, dropping to 10 mph within each of the Loop&#8217;s three stations, and a restriction to just 11 vehicles.<\/p>\n<p>Deputy Fire Chief Warren Whitney of the Clark County Fire Department said that TBC had told him the company wasn&#8217;t allowed to use Tesla&#8217;s collision warning systems within the Loop. A <a href=\"https:\/\/www.documentcloud.org\/documents\/20792266-2021-5-11-ats-certificate\">transportation system certificate<\/a> issued by Clark County this week specified that the Loop must use &#8220;non-autonomous&#8221; &#8220;manually driven&#8221; vehicles. It was issued for the planned 62 vehicles. Neither Clark County officials nor TBC provided responses to detailed questions on the operational restrictions, nor indicated when or if they could be lifted.<\/p>\n<p>Toyota has previously warned that its radar-based collision warning system may not function correctly within tunnels.<\/p>\n<p>It is not clear whether the Teslas are capable of safe and &#8220;fully autonomous operation&#8221; without their collision-warning radars, although Musk has suggested &#8212; and now executed on a plan &#8212; to remove radar sensors from its vehicles and only use cameras. Tesla started delivering Model 3 and Model Y vehicles in May that <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2021\/05\/25\/tesla-is-no-longer-using-radar-sensors-in-model-3-and-model-y-vehicles-built-in-north-america\/\">do not have radar sensors<\/a>. The lack of radar sensors has prompted the National Highway Traffic and Safety Administration to say that Model 3 and Model Y vehicles built on or after April 27, 2021 will no longer receive the <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2021\/05\/27\/tesla-has-activated-its-in-car-camera-to-monitor-drivers-using-autopilot\/\">agency&#8217;s check mark<\/a> for automatic emergency braking, forward collision warning, lane departure warning and dynamic brake support. The decision also prompted Consumer Reports to no longer list the Model 3 as a Top Pick, and the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety said it plans to remove the Model 3&#8217;s Top Safety Pick+ designation.<\/p>\n<p>The Fire Department also had concerns about dealing with emergencies within the tunnels, including battery fires that can potentially last many hours. &#8220;There have been cases where electric cars have caught fire without an accident,&#8221; Whitney told TechCrunch. &#8220;Our plan right now would be just to get the people out, then pull back and let the fire continue to burn.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>Whitney noted the system has many cameras and smoke alarms, as well as a &#8220;robust&#8221; ventilation system that can move 400,000 cubic feet of air per minute in either direction down the tunnels. This should allow passengers and drivers to escape on foot around the cars. For less serious incidents, TBC has a tow vehicle (also a Tesla) to extract broken-down cars.<\/p>\n<p>Neither TBC nor Clark County replied to TechCrunch queries about whether the Loop would be allowed to transport wheelchair users, children or infants usually requiring car seats, people with other mobility issues or pets and support animals.<\/p>\n<p>Firefighters have already conducted multiple drills in the underground system, including simulated accidents far from a station, with two or three other vehicles in the way. &#8220;Eleven cars is definitely doable,&#8221; says Whitney. &#8220;But when you start increasing numbers of cars, it may be a problem. [TBC] is a for-profit company and is going want to maximize the efficiency, so there may be further discussions as they try to increase the capacity.&#8221;<\/p>\n<h2>Expansion plans<\/h2>\n<p>Not only does TBC want to use more vehicles in the existing Loop, it is already planning to expand the system. At the end of March, TBC told Clark County that it had broken ground on an extension from one LVCC station to the new Resorts World hotel, and it is has permission for a similar spur to the Encore nearby.<\/p>\n<p>More significantly, TBC also wants to build a transit system covering much of the Strip and downtown Las Vegas with more than 40 stations connecting dozens of hotels, attractions and, ultimately, the airport. That system would be financed by TBC and supported by ticket sales.<\/p>\n<p>The viability of those expansions could depend on how soon TBC can meet the technological and operational promises it made for its relatively simple LVCC Loop, and demonstrate whether taxis in tunnels can generate as much revenue as they do column inches.<\/p>\n<div class=\"embed breakout\">\n<blockquote class=\"wp-embedded-content\" data-secret=\"rRoZvBv8gr\"><p><a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2020\/10\/16\/elon-musks-las-vegas-loop-might-only-carry-a-fraction-of-the-passengers-it-promised\/\">Elon Musk&#8217;s Las Vegas Loop might only carry a fraction of the passengers it promised<\/a><\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p><iframe class=\"wp-embedded-content\" sandbox=\"allow-scripts\" security=\"restricted\" style=\"position: absolute; clip: rect(1px, 1px, 1px, 1px);\" title=\"&#8220;Elon Musk&#8217;s Las Vegas Loop might only carry a fraction of the passengers it promised&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch\" src=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2020\/10\/16\/elon-musks-las-vegas-loop-might-only-carry-a-fraction-of-the-passengers-it-promised\/embed\/#?secret=rRoZvBv8gr\" data-secret=\"rRoZvBv8gr\" width=\"800\" height=\"450\" frameborder=\"0\" marginwidth=\"0\" marginheight=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\"><\/iframe><\/div>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Please see update below&#8230; Restrictions put in place by Nevada regulators are making it difficult for The Boring Company (TBC) to meet contractual targets for its LVCC Loop, Elon Musk&#8217;s first underground transportation system.

in Las Vegas, Nevada. The Las Vegas Convention Center Loop is an underground transportation system that is the first commercial project by Elon Musk\u2019s The Boring Company. The USD 52.5 million loop, which includes two one-way vehicle tunnels 40 feet beneath the ground and three passenger stations, will take convention attendees across the 200-acre convention campus for free in all-electric Tesla vehicles in under two minutes. To walk that distance can take upward of 25 minutes. The system is designed to carry 4,400 people per hour using a fleet of 62 vehicles at maximum capacity. It is scheduled to be fully operational in June when the facility plans to host its first large-scale convention since the COVID-19 shutdown. There are plans to expand the system throughout the resort corridor in the future.

the business realm they have yielded a change in corporate behavior and consumer expectation &#8212; changes that showed up in a bushel of earnings reports this week.<\/p>\n<p>TechCrunch may tend to have a private-company focus, but we do keep tabs on public companies in the tech world as they often provide hints, notes and other pointers on how startups may be faring. In this case, however, we\u2019re working in reverse; startups have told us for several quarters now that their markets are picking up momentum as customers shake up their buying behavior with a distinct advantage for companies helping customers move into the digital realm. And public company results are now confirming the startups\u2019 perspective.<\/p>\n<p>The accelerating digital transformation is real, and we have the data to support the point.<\/p>\n<p>What follows is a digest of notes concerning the recent earnings results from Box, Sprout Social, Yext, Snowflake and Salesforce. We\u2019ll approach each in micro to save time, but as always there\u2019s more digging to be done if you have time.

Today its shares are up 18%. And a call with the company\u2019s CEO Howard Lerman underscored our general thesis regarding the digital transformation\u2019s acceleration.<\/p>\n<p>In brief, Yext\u2019s evolution from a company that plugged corporate information into external search engines to building and selling search tech itself has been resonating in the market. Why? Lerman explained that consumers more and more expect digital service in response to their questions &#8212; &#8220;who wants to call a 1-800 number,&#8221; he asked rhetorically &#8212; which is forcing companies to rethink the way they handle customer inquiries.<\/p>\n<p>In turn, those companies are looking to companies like Yext that offer technology to better answer customer queries in a digital format. It\u2019s customer-friendly, and could save companies money as call centers are expensive.

is the new AI research outfit from OpenAI&#8217;s Dario Amodei, and it has $124M to burn"},"content":{"rendered":"<p id=\"speakable-summary\">As AI has grown from a menagerie of research projects to include a handful of titanic, industry-powering models like GPT-3, there is a need for the sector to evolve \u2014 or so thinks Dario Amodei, former VP of research at OpenAI, who struck out on his own to create a new company a few months ago. <a href=\"https:\/\/www.anthropic.com\/\">Anthropic<\/a>, as it&#8217;s called, was founded with his sister Daniela and its goal is to create &#8220;large-scale AI systems that are steerable, interpretable, and robust.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>The challenge the siblings Amodei are tackling is simply that these AI models, while incredibly powerful, are not well understood. GPT-3, which they worked on, is an astonishingly versatile language system that can produce extremely convincing text in practically any style, and on any topic.<\/p>\n<div class=\"embed breakout\">\n<blockquote class=\"wp-embedded-content\" data-secret=\"hDo1z2rXH9\"><p><a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2021\/03\/17\/okay-the-gpt-3-hype-seems-pretty-reasonable\/\">Okay, the GPT-3 hype seems pretty reasonable<\/a><\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p><iframe class=\"wp-embedded-content\" sandbox=\"allow-scripts\" security=\"restricted\" style=\"position: absolute; clip: rect(1px, 1px, 1px, 1px);\" title=\"&#8220;Okay, the GPT-3 hype seems pretty reasonable&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch\" src=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2021\/03\/17\/okay-the-gpt-3-hype-seems-pretty-reasonable\/embed\/#?secret=hDo1z2rXH9\" data-secret=\"hDo1z2rXH9\" width=\"800\" height=\"450\" frameborder=\"0\" marginwidth=\"0\" marginheight=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\"><\/iframe><\/div>\n<p>But say you had it generate rhyming couplets with Shakespeare and Pope as examples. How does it do it? What is it &#8220;thinking&#8221;? Which knob would you tweak, which dial would you turn, to make it more melancholy, less romantic, or limit its diction and lexicon in specific ways? Certainly there are parameters to change here and there, but really no one knows exactly how this extremely convincing language sausage is being made.<\/p>\n<p>It&#8217;s one thing to not know when an AI model is generating poetry, quite another when the model is watching a department store for suspicious behavior, or fetching legal precedents for a judge about to pass down a sentence. Today the general rule is: the more powerful the system, the harder it is to explain its actions. That&#8217;s not exactly a good trend.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;Large, general systems of today can have significant benefits, but can also be unpredictable, unreliable, and opaque: our goal is to make progress on these issues,&#8221; reads the company&#8217;s self-description. &#8220;For now, we\u2019re primarily focused on research towards these goals; down the road, we foresee many opportunities for our work to create value commercially and for public benefit.&#8221;<\/p>\n<div class=\"embed breakout\">\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\" data-width=\"550\" data-dnt=\"true\">\n<p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Excited to announce what we\u2019ve been working on this year &#8211; <a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/AnthropicAI?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">@AnthropicAI<\/a>, an AI safety and research company. If you\u2019d like to help us combine safety research with scaling ML models while thinking about societal impacts, check out our careers page <a href=\"https:\/\/t.co\/TVHA0t7VLc\">https:\/\/t.co\/TVHA0t7VLc<\/a><\/p>\n<p>&mdash; Daniela Amodei (@DanielaAmodei) <a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/DanielaAmodei\/status\/1398306463945158656?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">May 28, 2021<\/a><\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p><script async src=\"https:\/\/platform.twitter.com\/widgets.js\" charset=\"utf-8\"><\/script><\/div>\n<p>The goal seems to be to integrate safety principles into the existing priority system of AI development that generally favors efficiency and power. Like any other industry, it&#8217;s easier and more effective to incorporate something from the beginning than to bolt it on at the end. Attempting to make some of the biggest models out there able to be picked apart and understood may be more work than building them in the first place. Anthropic seems to be starting fresh.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;Anthropic\u2019s goal is to make the fundamental research advances that will let us build more capable, general, and reliable AI systems, then deploy these systems in a way that benefits people,&#8221; said Dario Amodei, CEO of the new venture, in a short post announcing the company and its $124 million in funding.<\/p>\n<p>That funding, by the way, is as star-studded as you might expect. It was led by Skype co-founder Jaan Tallinn, and included James McClave, Dustin Moskovitz, Eric Schmidt and the Center for Emerging Risk Research, among others.<\/p>\n<p>The company is a public benefit corporation, and the plan for now, as the limited information on the site suggests, is to remain heads-down on researching these fundamental questions of how to make large models more tractable and interpretable. We can expect more information later this year, perhaps, as the mission and team coalesces and initial results pan out.<\/p>\n<p>The name, incidentally, is adjacent to anthropocentric, and concerns relevancy to human experience or existence. Perhaps it derives from the &#8220;Anthropic principle,&#8221; the notion that intelligent life is possible in the universe because&#8230; well, we&#8217;re here. If intelligence is inevitable under the right conditions, the company just has to create those conditions.<\/p>\n<div class=\"embed breakout\">\n<blockquote class=\"wp-embedded-content\" data-secret=\"YwUPQJOa6R\"><p><a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2021\/01\/07\/google-ai-concocts-breakie-and-cakie-hybrid-baked-goods\/\">Google AI concocts &#8216;breakie&#8217;

racial bias in video games"},"content":{"rendered":"<p id=\"speakable-summary\">Protests across the U.S. over police violence and systemic racism against Black Americans have sparked gaming companies like Electronic Arts, Epic Games and Sony Interactive Entertainment\/PlayStation to publish <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theesa.com\/perspectives\/video-game-industry-response-to-nationwide-protests\/\">statements of their support<\/a> and make donations to relevant advocacy organizations.<\/p>\n<p>These are positive actions, but the most impactful thing game companies can do is take action internally. Racial bias is baked, usually unintentionally, into games by those who develop them. This creates a recurring pattern of Black and Latinx characters being stereotyped or completely absent in games, which is invalidating and demeaning.<\/p>\n<p>There are <a href=\"https:\/\/newzoo.com\/insights\/articles\/the-global-games-market-will-generate-152-1-billion-in-2019-as-the-u-s-overtakes-china-as-the-biggest-market\/\">2.5 billion gamers<\/a> in the world, a group that includes consumers across every ethnicity and age (especially in mobile gaming, the largest market segment). <a href=\"https:\/\/qz.com\/1433085\/the-era-of-white-male-games-for-white-male-gamers-is-ending\/\">Quartz has noted<\/a> that \u201c57% of video game players in the U.S. between the ages of 6 and 29 will be people of color in less than 10 years.\u201d Black and Latinx youth in the US <a href=\"http:\/\/cmhd.northwestern.edu\/wp-content\/uploads\/2011\/06\/SOCconfReportSingleFinal-1.pdf\">spend more time per day<\/a>, on average, on both mobile games and console games than white youth. For hundreds of millions of gamers globally \u2014 particularly in demographics driving the industry\u2019s rapid growth \u2014 there are very few games whose stories center on characters like them. That is also a missed business opportunity.<\/p><div class=\"piano-inline-promo\"><\/div>\n<p>\u201cTelling these stories isn\u2019t as niche as people think it is. Look at [the Marvel movie] <i>Black Panther<\/i>,\u201d says Rashad Redic, co-founder and Chief Creative Officer of <a href=\"http:\/\/brasslionentertainment.com\/\">Brass Lion Entertainment<\/a>, \u201cThe content is defined by whether it&#8217;s entertaining, period.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Beyond characters\u2019 skin color, there are subtle aspects of game development that contribute to underrepresentation or misrepresentation. The consistent view among gaming executives and researchers I interviewed for this article is that the lack of diversity among employees at leading gaming companies results in leadership remaining largely oblivious to this.<\/p>\n<p>Raising this simple critique isn\u2019t always welcome. Games industry journalist Gita Jackson, for example, has described the criticism she gets anytime she mentions the race of characters within a game. \u201cI think the presence of more video game characters who are women of color is good \u2026 These should not be controversial statements \u2014 I\u2019m simply stating something I appreciate, something that\u2019s relevant to me,\u201d she <a href=\"https:\/\/kotaku.com\/what-its-like-to-write-about-race-and-video-games-1832886047\">wrote last year<\/a>, \u201cand yet some readers responded as if I\u2019d suggested that all gamers should amputate their pinky toes.\u201d<\/p>\n<h2>Character representation<\/h2>\n<p>One of the most extensive studies of racial representation in games was <a href=\"http:\/\/dmitriwilliams.com\/VirtualCensusFinal.pdf\">a 2009 study<\/a> that analyzed 150 of the most popular titles. Black characters comprised 10.7% of characters, roughly on parity with the then-most recent census data that 12.3% of Americans are Black, and only 2.7% of characters were Latinx (relative to 12.5% representation in the U.S. population). But Dmitri Williams, a professor at the University of Southern California and the lead author of that study, says that Black representation is even lower if you only look at primary characters and that in any case \u201cathletes in sports games account for most of the Black characters in those games.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Kishonna Gray, a professor at the University of Illinois\u2014Chicago, highlights that merely tracking the number of Black characters present in games misses the point of how they are represented. \u201cIn film, there have historically been three roles you see Black characters in: Black as violent, Black as the sidekick, Black as the help. This has also been true in video games.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Furthermore, she argues that \u201csports games should be removed from those analyses since they are just copying real people from the real world\u201d and mask the statistics that would show how infrequently Black characters arise from the creative process at most game studios.<\/p>\n<p>Casting specific demographics in a certain light in any form of media has an impact on consumers\u2019 perception of those demographics in the real world. At least <a href=\"https:\/\/www.researchgate.net\/profile\/Grace_Yang9\/publication\/263697104_Effects_of_Avatar_Race_in_Violent_Video_Games_on_Racial_Attitudes_and_Aggression\/links\/0deec53baedee5e0fd000000\/Effects-of-Avatar-Race-in-Violent-Video-Games-on-Racial-Attitudes-and-Aggression.pdf\">one academic study<\/a> found that white participants were more likely to associate Black faces with negative words after playing a violent video game as a Black character than after playing a violent video game as a white character.<\/p>\n<p>When the only option to experience the fantasy worlds of many games is through white characters, it internalizes in many gamers that those fantasy worlds weren\u2019t designed for them. \u201cAnything is possible in games,\u201d Gray told me in reference to her passion for the industry, \u201cBut anything is only possible for white characters. When they add Black characters to a game they root them only in their real world context \u2026 why can\u2019t Black characters ride dragons?\u201d<\/p>\n<h2>Game developer demographics<\/h2>\n<p>Data has shown that the representation of different races within games correlates to the racial makeup of the game development community. According to Williams. \u201cIt was pretty much a one-for-one representation.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>The International Game Developers Association (IGDA) found in the <a href=\"https:\/\/s3-us-east-2.amazonaws.com\/igda-website\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/01\/29093706\/IGDA-DSS-2019_Summary-Report_Nov-20-2019.pdf\">2019 edition of its annual survey<\/a> that among game developers worldwide:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\">81% identify as \u201cwhite\/Caucasian\/European\u201d<\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\">7% identify as \u201cHispanic\/Latinx\u201d<\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\">2% identify as \u201cBlack\/African-American\/African\/Afro-Caribbean\u201d<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>\u201cPeople draw their inspiration from their experience,\u201d explained Gray, \u201cthat\u2019s why we still have a problem with representation.\u201d Redic said that during his career \u2014 which includes roles at top gaming companies like Bethesda and Crytek \u2014 he has frequently been \u201cthe only \u2014 or one of very few \u2014 Black guy among hundreds of game devs at a company.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Tanya DePass, founder of the nonprofit I Need Diverse Games, makes the point that for companies wanting to improve diversity in their content, \u201cthe biggest thing is diverse staff, and diverse staff at leadership level.\u201d Moreover, her advice to game studios is to hire outside experts who can review their development plans and give feedback on where their content may stereotype or misrepresent an ethnic group: \u201cBring in diversity consultants in the beginning, not a month before launch, and treat it seriously.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>One company that uses consultants is Niantic, the studio behind Pok\u00e9mon Go and Harry Potter: Wizards Unite. It has also implemented \u201cDiversity and Inclusion check-ins through a game\u2019s concept, preproduction and postproduction phases,\u201d according Trinidad Hermida, the company&#8217;s Head of Diversity and Inclusion. \u201cThese check-ins look at everything from character design to evaluating whether the internal Niantic team working the product is diverse,\u201d she explained, \u201cEvery new game we publish must go through this process to launch.\u201d<\/p>\n<h2>Good intentions, slow progress<\/h2>\n<p>That <a href=\"https:\/\/s3-us-east-2.amazonaws.com\/igda-website\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/01\/29093706\/IGDA-DSS-2019_Summary-Report_Nov-20-2019.pdf\">IGDA survey<\/a> last year also found that 87% of game developers said \u201cdiversity in game content\u201d is \u201cvery important\u201d or \u201csomewhat important,\u201d which offers optimism that representation can improve as developers are pushed to think of diversity less in the abstract and more in the context of the specific games they work on.<\/p>\n<p>The number of Black or Latinx characters across popular games is indeed growing, even if that progress is quite slow relative to the pace at which the demographic makeup of the gaming community is diversifying. Examples can be found in Moby Games\u2019 <a href=\"https:\/\/www.mobygames.com\/game-group\/protagonist-black\">list of games with Black protagonists<\/a> through 2017 and the <a href=\"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/List_of_black_video_game_characters\">list of Black video game characters<\/a> on Wikipedia.<\/p>\n<p>Giving users lots of options to customize their avatar\u2019s appearance goes a long way in helping different demographics of gamers feel welcomed and emotionally attached to a game. This is increasingly common in games, but there are often more limited options for Black avatars, like the ability to choose natural hair styles. DePass says that game developers \u201care often not thinking about the fact that there are other people who also want to see themselves [in creating their avatar].\u201d And when they do, the homogeneity of their team can lead to foreseeable mistakes. For example, DePass expressed that \u201cIf Black hair is available at all, it looks bad. Sometimes there&#8217;s 5 inches between braids; or Afros look like steel wool. It\u2019s like, &#8216;Have you ever met a Black person or seen photos of black hairstyles?&#8217;\u201d<\/p>\n<h2>Cyberbullying<\/h2>\n<p>Cyberbullying is a big issue in games, MMOs in particular, and in their efforts to combat it, gaming executives should recognize that both female gamers and Black and Latinx founders are particularly targeted with abuse, often denigrated with slurs and racist jokes.<\/p>\n<p>A small but important step that developers can take, according to Gray, is giving players the option to mark racist behavior as the reason for submitting a complaint against another user. Many games have added the ability to mark a complaint as being due to gender discrimination, she notes, but the lack of a similar option for racism permits game studios to remain ignorant about how often racism occurs on their platform. Collecting data on a problem allows for more measurement of that problem and more effective action to address it.<\/p>\n<h2>Building for an underserved market<\/h2>\n<p>As DePass noted in our call, \u201cThere aren\u2019t a lot of Black creators of games, but there are a lot of Black buyers of games.\u201d There is business opportunity in creating content that better speaks to often-overlooked segments of the gamer community.<\/p>\n<p>The natural question here is: If making games with narratives that center on Black or Latinx characters is a compelling business opportunity, why hasn\u2019t it already been tapped? Leadership at established gaming companies \u201chave a sense of who <i>is<\/i> a gamer, and who <i>isn\u2019t<\/i>, that is very archaic\u201d says <a href=\"https:\/\/glowup.games\/\">Glow Up Games<\/a> CEO Mitu Khandaker, whose studio is developing a mobile game leveraging IP from the HBO show &#8220;Insecure.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>Likewise, she explains, entrepreneurs who found their own studios with this thesis quickly find that the major funding sources (publishers and venture capitalists) are composed of ethnically homogenous teams who are quick to judge such games as niche.<\/p>\n<p>As a result, the game developers focused on building games that speak to Black and Latinx audiences remain stuck in the indie games space, lacking the resources or industry credibility to develop a AAA title.<\/p>\n<p>There\u2019s a long list of societal problems that contribute to the disproportionately small number of Black software engineers entering the games industry or in leadership roles in the industry, from less access to high-quality STEM education in K-12 to employers <a href=\"https:\/\/www.brookings.edu\/blog\/brown-center-chalkboard\/2019\/11\/22\/hbcus-are-leading-centers-of-education-why-are-they-treated-as-second-class-institutions\/\">devaluing degrees from historically Black colleges and universities<\/a> to the well-researched pattern of <a href=\"https:\/\/hbswk.hbs.edu\/item\/minorities-who-whiten-job-resumes-get-more-interviews\">resumes with white-sounding names<\/a>\u00a0receiving dramatically more job interviews.<\/p>\n<p>Khandaker noted that the perceived lack of representation and role models for Black engineers looking at the gaming industry causes many to avoid the sector altogether, and many who enter the industry leave it in frustration.<\/p>\n<h2>Taking responsibility<\/h2>\n<p>On our recent call, Williams shared his memory of speaking on a panel about racial bias in games at the DICE Conference for game executives: \u201cIn the few minutes of transition between the prior session and my panel, roughly 90% of the audience left.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>A repeated sentiment among several of those I interviewed for this post was that the problem is not gaming executives with harmful intent so much as gaming executives lacking the interest or empathy to treat diversity as an issue that they personally should dedicate time to address. Discussion of diversity, whether at conferences or otherwise, is still too often treated as a token matter for purposes of political correctness, not a pressing business problem to solve.<\/p>\n<p>If the current news cycle is helping change that attitude and energize executives in the industry to step up, the most impactful action they can take is to approach diversity as a product development priority not as a PR issue.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Protests across the U.S. over police violence and systemic racism against Black Americans have sparked gaming companies like Electronic Arts, Epic Games and Sony Interactive Entertainment\/PlayStation to publish statements of their support and make donations to relevant advocacy organizations.
